Multi-AI Agent System for Voice Search
Designed and Implemented by 

Dr. G R Anil,  Jeevan Prakash K. 


1. Project Overview

This project aims to develop a multi-AI agent system that can perform voice search from a local database or YouTube and provide audio or visual feedback accordingly.

2. System Functionality

* Voice Input:
    * Captures user voice input using a Speech-to-Text (STT) library.
    * Processes the speech into text.
* Search:
    * Local Database:
        * Searches the local database for the query or related keywords.
        * If a match is found, retrieves the corresponding audio file path.
    * YouTube Search (if no local match):
        * Queries YouTube using the YouTube Data API.
        * Filters and ranks results based on relevance.
        * Retrieves the top result's URL.
* Response Generation:
    * Local Audio Match:
        * Plays the audio file associated with the local search result.
    * YouTube Video Match:
        * Provides the YouTube URL to the user (e.g., display or Text-to-Speech).
    * No Match:
        * Informs the user that no results were found in the local database or YouTube.

3. System Architecture

The system comprises three main agents:

* Voice Input Agent: Handles STT and initial processing.
* Search Agent: Performs local and YouTube searches.
* Response Generation Agent: Generates the final response (audio playback, URL display, or text-to-speech).

4. Technologies Used

* Programming Language: Python (replace with your chosen language)
* Speech Recognition Library (e.g., SpeechRecognition)
* Local Database (e.g., SQLite)
* YouTube Data API Client Library
* Audio Playback Library (e.g., playsound)
* Text-to-Speech Library (optional, e.g., pyttsx3, Google Cloud Text-to-Speech)
* Communication Mechanism (e.g., message queues, shared memory)

5. Project Setup Instructions

1. Install required libraries (refer to code for specific libraries).
2. Configure the local database (create tables, store audio files).
3. Obtain a YouTube Data API key (if using YouTube search).

6. Further Enhancements (Optional)

* Contextual awareness based on user history and preferences.
* Sentiment analysis to tailor responses.
* Visual search integration.
* Multilingual support.
* Cloud deployment.

7. Conclusio

This multi-AI agent system demonstrates a framework for voice search with local database and YouTube integration. By following this documentation and customizing the code, you can build a robust and informative voice search application.
